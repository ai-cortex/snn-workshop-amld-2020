# Spiking Neural Networks for real-time inference tasks

## Workshop — Applied Machine Learning Days 2020

This repository contains materials for the AMLD2020 workshop on using SNNs for low-power, real-time inference tasks.

Thanks for joining us at the workshop! We would appreciate your feedback here: https://bit.ly/amld2020_snn

## Working with the notebooks

1. Go to Google CoLab: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. File | Open notebook…
3. Choose the "GitHub" tab
4. In the search field, enter "synsense"
5. Choose the repository "synsense/snn-workshop-amld-2020"
6. The list of notebooks should populate automatically
7. Choose a notebook, and it will open a copy for you

Here's a link to the introductory notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/github/ai-cortex/snn-workshop-amld-2020/blob/master/Notebooks/1_IntroToSNNs/1_IntroToSNNs.ipynb

### Running the notebooks locally

The notebooks should install the packages they need. But just in case, here is a short list

* SINABS and dependencies: https://synsense.gitlab.io/sinabs/

* Rockpool and dependencies: https://synsense.gitlab.io/rockpool/

  * NEST; using `conda install -c conda-forge nest-simulator`  is easiest

  * Jax; using `pip install jax jaxlib`  is easiest
